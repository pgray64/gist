      <h4>What is this page for?</h4>
      <p>This is a template for building your own "Frequently Asked Questions" page.  It was generated automatically as part of the expanded seed app provided by <a href="https://sailsjs.com/about">Sails</a>.  On top of its primary purpose as a template, this page doubles as a handy guide about the seed app itself.</p>
      <p><small>Before you deploy this app to production, be sure to replace the content on this page with real questions and answers that are relevant to your project.  Or if you don't need an FAQ, just delete this file altogether.</small></p>
